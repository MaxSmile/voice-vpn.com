  {
    id: "free-and-credits",
    q: "Is Voice VPN really free?",
    a: "Yes. Voice VPN is ad-supported and uses a simple credit system instead of forcing a subscription. You can start without creating an account.",
  },
  {
    id: "censored-regions",
    q: "Does it work in censored regions (UAE, China, Iran)?",
    a: "Voice VPN is built to stay usable on restrictive networks by blending in with normal traffic. Results can vary by network; if it slows down, reconnect once or try a different server/region.",
  },
  {
    id: "signup-and-logs",
    q: "Do I need to sign up, and do you keep activity logs?",
    a: "No sign-up is required. The app is designed to minimize data collection and not keep browsing activity logs. For details, check the Privacy page.",
  },
  {
    id: "safe-apk-install",
    q: "How do I install the APK safely?",
    a: "Download the APK from the official link on this site (or Google Play), open it, and follow Android’s prompts. Avoid third‑party reuploads to reduce the risk of tampered files.",
  },
  {
    id: "what-is-a-vpn",
    q: "What is a VPN (in simple words)?",
    a: "A VPN is like a protected tunnel for your internet. Your device connects to a VPN server first, then your traffic goes out from there—helping protect you on public Wi‑Fi and bypass some blocks.",
  },
  {
    id: "does-vpn-make-anonymous",
    q: "Does a VPN make me anonymous?",
    a: "Not fully. A VPN can hide your traffic from the local network and your ISP, but websites you log into can still know it’s you. Think “more privacy,” not “invisible.”",
  },
  {
    id: "what-vpn-hides",
    q: "What does Voice VPN hide, and from whom?",
    a: "On a network level, it helps hide your browsing traffic from the Wi‑Fi operator and makes it harder for local networks to see what sites you visit. The destination sites can still see your connection, just from a VPN server.",
  },
  {
    id: "can-vpn-see-traffic",
    q: "Can a VPN see my traffic?",
    a: "A VPN provider can potentially see network metadata and, depending on the traffic type, some content. That’s why provider trust and privacy practices matter. Voice VPN is built to minimize collection; see Privacy for specifics.",
  },
  {
    id: "public-wifi",
    q: "Should I use a VPN on public Wi‑Fi?",
    a: "Yes, it’s a good habit. Public Wi‑Fi can be monitored or spoofed. A VPN helps protect your traffic from local eavesdropping and makes it harder to tamper with your connection.",
  },
  {
    id: "school-work-blocks",
    q: "Will Voice VPN bypass school/work blocks?",
    a: "Sometimes. It depends on how the network blocks traffic. Voice VPN is designed to work where many VPNs fail, but some networks can still block or degrade VPN connections.",
  },
  {
    id: "speed-impact",
    q: "Will a VPN slow my internet down?",
    a: "A little, usually. Your traffic takes an extra hop through a server. Voice VPN aims to keep speeds stable; choosing a nearby server and using a strong signal helps.",
  },
  {
    id: "choose-server",
    q: "Should I use Automatic server selection or pick a location?",
    a: "Automatic is best for most people—it picks a good default. Pick a location if you need a specific region or if a network behaves better with a certain server.",
  },
  {
    id: "streaming",
    q: "Will it work with streaming apps?",
    a: "Sometimes, but streaming services may block VPNs. Voice VPN focuses on reliable access and censorship resistance; streaming compatibility can change over time.",
  },
  {
    id: "gaming",
    q: "Is Voice VPN good for gaming?",
    a: "It can help if your network is unstable or blocked, but it may add latency. For best results, use a nearby server and test performance for your game.",
  },
  {
    id: "battery-data",
    q: "Does using a VPN drain battery or use more data?",
    a: "It can use a bit more battery because it encrypts traffic and stays connected. Data usage is mostly your normal traffic plus a small overhead from encryption.",
  },
  {
    id: "credits-how-it-works",
    q: "How do credits work?",
    a: "Credits buy connection time. Roughly, 1 credit ≈ 30 minutes. A small cost applies when you connect, then additional charges apply as time passes.",
  },
  {
    id: "avoid-double-charging",
    q: "Can I be charged twice if I tap connect/disconnect quickly?",
    a: "The app tries to deduplicate rapid actions to avoid accidental double-charging for the same moment. If something looks off, use in-app feedback to report it.",
  },
  {
    id: "out-of-credits",
    q: "What happens when I run out of credits?",
    a: "The VPN stops automatically so you don’t keep using time you don’t have. You can earn more credits or choose a premium option if available.",
  },
  {
    id: "earn-credits",
    q: "How can I earn credits?",
    a: "Common ways include rewarded ads, daily bonuses via in-app activities, and achievements. Availability can vary by region/device.",
  },
  {
    id: "buy-credits",
    q: "Can I buy credits instead of watching ads?",
    a: "Yes—credit packs are intended as one-time top-ups if you prefer not to earn credits through ads.",
  },
  {
    id: "subscription",
    q: "Do you offer a subscription for unlimited use?",
    a: "If subscription is available in your region, it unlocks unlimited connection time while active (credits are not charged).",
  },
  {
    id: "referrals",
    q: "What are referral links/IDs?",
    a: "A referral link or ID is a shareable invite. If a friend installs using it, it helps track the invite and can enable rewards depending on the current program rules.",
  },
  {
    id: "support-and-bugs",
    q: "How do I report a bug or send feedback?",
    a: "Use the in-app support/feedback screens to send a report. Include what network you were on, what you tapped, and what you expected to happen—details help fix issues faster.",
  },
  {
    id: "is-it-legal",
    q: "Is using a VPN legal?",
    a: "Laws vary by country and situation. In many places VPNs are legal, but some regions restrict them. You are responsible for following local laws and service rules.",
  },
